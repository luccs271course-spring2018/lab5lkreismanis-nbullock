* Why does LinkedStack not require an explicit constructor?
- jkljkljkljlk
* What is the time and (extra) space complexity of each of the LinkedStack methods, as well as ReverseLines.main?

* How else (not using Node) could we have implemented LinkedStack in such a way that it is still based on a linked list but the asList method uses constant time and space?

* Is it better for push and pop to return the item or the stack itself? Briefly discuss the pros and cons of each design.
